# COMP4462-Final-Project 
 

This repository contains the code and data for the visualizations of the final project of Group 3. 

 
The visualizations were implemented with Tableau and JavaScript in two dashboards 

 

## Usage 

The interactive and static dashboards can be viewed with the following steps. 

1. Open the `COMP4462_Finalproduct.twb` file. 

2. Click **Cancel** when the "Extract Not Found" window appears. 

3. In the "Dashboard Unavailable" window, click **Locate File**. 

4. In the pop-up window, navigate to the `/Data` directory and open the `governor_shooting_merged_v2.csv` file. 

5. Repeat the previous step until there are no more missing file requests. 

6. In the "Extract Not Found" window, select the **Regenerate the extract** option. 

7. Save the extract file (a `.hyper` file) locally. 

 
In step 4, Tableau should ask for input four times.
